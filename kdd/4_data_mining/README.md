*A sequence u is a subsequence of x if all successive elements u i of u appear in x in the same
order, which we simply denote by u ⊂ x. According to this definition, unshared states can appear
between those common to both sequences u and x. For example, u = S, M is a subsequence of
x = S, U, M, M C.*
